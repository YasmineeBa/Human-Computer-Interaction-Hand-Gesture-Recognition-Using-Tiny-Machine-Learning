# Human-Computer-Interaction-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Using-Tiny-Machine-Learning

Many nowadays’ platforms such as interactive environments require more natural and intuitive user interaction, such as hand gestures. 
Therfore, Accurate interactions between humans and machines can be achieved using hand gestures.
the solution is simulating the interaction with a game using gestures recognition.

Using two Nano 33 BLE Sense Arduino , we propose to control a game control with some gestures:
-jumping 
-moving left 
-Moving right 
-Shooting 
-Protecting
-Speed
To set the communication between the two Arduino, we use the UART  (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication protocol.
It allows an asynchronous serial communication in which the data format and transmission speed are configurable .
